# webscrapping-indeed
The purpose of this project is to design a course curriculum for a new “Master of Business and Management in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence” program at University of Toronto with focus not only on technical but also on business and soft skills. To achieve this goal, we had to extract skills that are in demand at the job market from job vacancies posted on indeed web-portal and apply clustering algorithms to group/segment skills into courses.
